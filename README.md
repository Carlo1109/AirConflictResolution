This project focuses on the **resolution of air traffic conflicts** in **hybrid systems**. Hybrid systems, combining discrete and continuous dynamics, are well-suited for modeling the behavior of aircraft in air traffic management. The goal is to develop algorithms that safely resolve conflicts (potential collisions or violations of safe separation) between two aircraft, while ensuring efficiency and scalability.
